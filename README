Changes:
- pathToLinks can be a directory. If it is a directory, program will process all of the files in there
- if program is interrupted and then run again, it will append all processed content to the previous existing files
- program merges all the files produces by his threads to one file, if this file exists, it will append the content

example arguments:
pathToLinks numberOfThreads language(folder which will be created next to the pathToLinks)
C:\WIKI2\cs.links.txt 8 CS

if program is closed and will start again it will replace current files so rename language option or save downloaded data somewhere else (TODO)

How to run
Just download jar and write to console somethink like that
java -jar WikiDownload2.jar C:\WIKI2\cs.links.txt 8 CS
